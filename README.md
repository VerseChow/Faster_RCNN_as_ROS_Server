# Faster_RCNN_as_ROS_Server
### Faster_RCNN_as_ROS_Server

This is a ROS Server served as an Object Detection using Faster_RCNN Method. Given an image and then output bbox information.

This idea comes form [FasterRCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf)

This code is modified from [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn), but I modified it as a ROS server to do specific task for object Recognition in [PROGRESSLAB](http://progress.eecs.umich.edu/)

### DEMO Instruction

To run this demo, you have to install caffe_model as mentioned in [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn) in scripts folder and include a pretrained .caffemodel file. For model to download, please contact me ywchow@umich.edu

#### Detail Usage
1. Please recursive clone my repo, make sure you have included caffe-fast-rcnn folder in scripts folder 
2. In scripts/caffe-fast-rcnn folder, make sure you have changed the branch to faster-rcnn branch, not master branch
3. In scripts/caffe-fast-rcnn folder, make a copy of Makefile.config.example as Make.config and uncomment the line: WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1
4. In scripts/caffe-fast-rcnn folder, add opencv_imgcodecs in file Makefile. It is around the line 174 in LIBRARIES variable. Then run ``make`` and ``make python``. And pip install *scikit-image*, *easydict*
5. In scripts/data/demo folder, include test images and make sure in client.py in scripts folder has specified the path of these test images.
6. In scripts/data/faster_rcnn_models, include pretrained model and make sure in demo.py in scripts folder has specified the path of pretrained model.
7. Run demo.py first, then run client.py

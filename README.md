# Faster_RCNN_as_ROS_Server
## Faster_RCNN_as_ROS_Server

This is a ROS Server served as an Object Detection using Faster_RCNN Method. Given an image and then output bbox information.

This idea comes form [FasterRCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf)

This code is modified from [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn), but I modified it as a ROS server to do specific task for object Recognition in [PROGRESSLAB](http://progress.eecs.umich.edu/)

## DEMO Instruction

To run this demo, you have to install caffe_model as mentioned in [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn) in scripts folder and include a pretrained .caffemodel file. For more detail about testing and training, please contact me ywchow@umich.edu

The demo video is shown on following youtube link [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dvnhPWKLrA)
